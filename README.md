# Pixel Art Editor
This project was created as a tool specifically for my use and thus may not work in alternate screen resolutions or setups.
# Why it was built
This editor allows for 3d visualization of color palettes, allowing you to see and select from gradients in 3d space. Color palettes are implemented through a separate python file that is imported.
# Editor features
- draw
- errase
- select
- copy
- pastemove
- zoom
- toggle between canvases for animation
- import image files
- save files
# Color palette features
- selection of colors
- placement and movement on a 2d palette
- highlighting for visualization of selected colors

# Future plans
This was built for testing and a basis of ideas for a 3d voxel editor that will export 2d pixel art images that represent isometric 3d objects. This would be a tool for game development simplifying asset creation by algorithmically creating 2d assets from many 3d angles of the object.
